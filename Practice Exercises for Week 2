## Practice Exercises for Week 2

**Excercise 1**
# Summary
Variables:Dog ID, User ID, Country, State, Sign in Count, Filter.
Mark Down: Details, Text
1) How many unique dogs are in the dataset (Indicated by the number of unique entires in Dog ID)?
2) How many unique (human) users are in the dataset (indicated by the numgber of unique entries in User ID)?

##Tableau
Columns:
Rows: Sign in Count
Filters: Dog ID (Group): Other "Other box is checked off"
DetaiL: Dog ID
Color: Dog ID (group)

## Comments:
Dog IDs with Sign in Count of above 175 are grouped and filtered out to exclude these outliers.

### Notes:
I was able to get around this issue by putting sign in count on rows, Dog ID on detail, 
and then right clicking on the axis --> edit axis --> fixed --> select 0 - 175.
once the axis is restricted then I manually drag selected (hold left click) data and made a group. 
Then i could put this dog id group in the filter card and it works.

#Summary
Variables: Total Tests Completed, Breed Type, Breed Group, Dimension. 
Markdown:
a) Identify the features of dogs or their ownwers that have correlated with increased completion socres in the past.
b) We will focus on examining features of dogs that correlate with differences in the number of tests the dogs complete.
c) How aspects of dogs personalities and breed types affect completion metrics

##Tableau
Columns:Breed Type
Rows: Breed Type Median(Total Tests Complete)
Filters: Dog ID (Group) : Other; Breed Type Select [Cross Breed, Mixed Breed/Other, Popular Hybrid, Pure Breed]

## Comments:
Median Total Tests Completed for all Breed Types is 7. Is this correct?

**Excercise 3**
#Summary
Variables: DNA tested, Dog Fixed, Total Tests Completed, Breed Type, Dog Fixed, DNA Tested, Total Tests Completed
Markdown:
a) to confirm whether or not the dog is pure-bred?
b) because they are really interested in finding out more about where their dog came from?

##Tableau
Columns: Breed Group
Rows: MEDIAN(Total Test Complete), CNTD(Dog ID)
Filters: Dog ID (Group): Other, Breed Group [Herding, Hound, Non-Sporting, Sporting, Terrier, Toy, Working], Dog ID [Other)

## Comments:
This bar chart shows the median Total Tests Completed for DNA Tested broken down by Dog Fixed.
The median Total Tests Completed is highest for dogs which are DNA tested but not spayed/neutered, 
which supports the hypothesis that owners which intend to breed their digs may be more interested 
in the personality of their dogs than other owners.

**Excercise 4**
#Summary
Variables: Dog ID, Country, Total Tets Completed, Show Me 
Markdown:
a) whether particular countries and/or states within the US have more Dognition customers than others?
b) whether customers within specific geographic regions are more likely to complete more tests?

##Tableau
Columns: Country
Rows: MEDIAN(Total Tets Complete) CNTD(Dog ID)
Filters: Dog ID(group): Other [select other], CNTD(Dog ID)[ 30, 10,262], Country [AU, CA, DE, DK, FR, GB, NO, NZ, US]
Color: Country

## Comments:
The charts show the median of Total Tests Completed and distinct count of Dog ID for each Country. 
The distinct count of Dog ID filter includes values greater than or equal to 30. 
Out of these countries, Germany, Denmark, Norway and New Zealand have higher median Total Tests Completed than the US.

**Excercise 5**
# Summary
Variables: Median ITI, Mean ITI, Dog ID, Total Tests Completed
a) We will throw out some data from dogs who completed 20 or more tests
b) Our analyses will be biased towards dogs who do not complete all the Dognition Assessments tests, which might not translate
well do dogs who do finish the Dogntion Assessment tets.

##Tableau
Columns: Total Tests Completed
Rows: Mean ITI(minutes) MedianITI(minutes)
Filters: Dog ID(group)[Other checked off]: Other, Total Tests Completed [1,19], Mean ITI(minutes)

## Comments:
The trend lines or Mean ITI and Median ITI go in opposite directions.
The median is less affected by outliers, the Median ITI trend line supports the hypothesis that 
customers who complete tests more quickly are more likely to complete more tests.
