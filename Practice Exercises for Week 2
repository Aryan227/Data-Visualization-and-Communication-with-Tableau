## Practice Exercises for Week 2

**Excercise 1**
Columns:
Rows: Sign in Count
Filters: Dog ID (Group): Other "Other box is checked off"
DetaiL: Dog ID
Color: Dog ID (group)

### Notes:
I was able to get around this issue by putting sign in count on rows, Dog ID on detail, and then right clicking on the axis --> edit axis --> fixed --> select 0 - 175.
once the axis is restricted then I manually drag selected (hold left click) data and made a group. Then i could put this dog id group in the filter card and it works.
