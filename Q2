## Mentor Hints for Week 2 Graded Quiz

Data sets
a. Salary Data Set

b. Dognition data

Question 1
Consider whether there are other ways to aggregate the variable you are examining that would be more 
appropriate for answering this question.

# Tableau

Question 2
The “View Data” function in the Tableau workspace might be helpful for answering this question.

# Steps:
1.Filter out the outliers in Dog ID (those with sign-in counts greater than 175). 
2. Place State in the Filter and display on "37".
3. Right-click on "11" and select "View Data". When the dialog box pops up, select "Full Data" at the bottom.
4. Immediately, you can select "They are all from Estonia", exclude "They are all golden retrievers" and "They are all charmers".
5. Scroll to the right till you see "Total Test Completed" and "Weight". You will see that "They all completed 37 tests" 
and "They all weight 37 pounds" should be excluded as well.

Question 3
The “View Data” function in the Tableau workspace might be helpful for answering this question.

Question 4
Make sure you have filtered out the group of dogs whose data we know is not real (see Exercise 1) 
and double-check that the type of aggregation you are using in your analysis is appropriate.

Question 5
Make sure the type of aggregation you are using in your analysis is appropriate.

Question 6
Please review Lesson 3 Let's Get Started to review how to arrive at the correct answer.

Question 7
Please review Lesson 3 Let's Get Started to review how to arrive at the correct answer.


Question 8
Please check that you are using the appropriate aggregation, and review Lesson 3
Let's Get Started and the course Practice Exercises for information about how to arrive at the correct answer.

# Variables & Filters:
There are three variables we are interested in: Dog Fixed, Breed Type and Average Number of Test Completed.
Filters: Dog ID( Group) Other

# Summary: 
There are three variables we are interested in: Dog Fixed, Breed Type and Average Number of Test Completed.

# Some immediate observations:
1. On average, fixed dogs completed more tests than non-fixed dogs on all breed types. All the bars in fixed dog category 
(1) are higher than in the non-fixed category (0)
2. The greatest difference is between the Mixed Breed/Other/I don't Know.

These are the only choices in the answer that are supported by data.

Question 9
Please review Lesson 3 Let's Get Started to review how to arrive at the correct answer.
# Summary: 
In addition to the three variables in Q8, there is an additional variable we are also interested in: DNA Tested. Add "DNA Tested" 
to the Column shelf in the order shown. Place the variables in this order will make analyzing the answer choices in Q9 
more straight forward.

# Steps:
Filter out the outliers in Dog ID (those with Sign-In Count greater than 175), since those accounts were created to test the system 
(it was mentioned in page 2 of the exercise PDF file).

# Analysis:
Answer choice: "The Cross-Breed dogs that were DNA tested but NOT fixed were mostly Labrador Retriever-Golden Retriever Mixes".
--->In the block for DNA tested but not fixed, the 3rd block from the left, right-click on the bar for Cross Breed, click on 
View Data and select Full Data at the bottom. You can immediately tell that the dogs in this category are mostly
Labrador Retriever-Golden Retriever Mixes.



Question 10
Check your filters, and make sure your aggregations are appropriate. 
See Practice Exercise 4 for more information about how to make the graph.

Question 11
Make sure your aggregations are appropriate, and remember that you can hover over the state to see 
the precise number of records in the tool tip.

## My hints for WEEK 2 Quiz
I have gotten stuck in week 2 for a couple of days and I have been so frustrated by almost all the problems in the quiz. 
I want to share my hints with you guys who have the same feeling.
Firstly, please clean the data according to the exercise, excluding dog ids with sign_in counts > 175.

**To clean the data**
1) unclick aggregate measures in analysis
2) rows: sign_in_count (sum)
3) drag dog ids into the marks card, detail
4) filter: sign_in_count < 175
5) select all the data, right click, then choose group
6) a new group (dog id group 1 here) has been created
7) put the new grouped dog id into filters from now on for the quiz

**Problem 1** 
1) rows: user id (count distinct)
2) filter: remove grouped dog id
3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 2**
1) columns: country, dimension, breed
2) rows: total tests completed (sum), weight
3) filter: state - 37
4) make sure to unclick aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 3** 
1) rows: sign in count(sum)
2) filter: remove the grouped dog id this time, sign in count > 175
3) view all data
4) make sure to unclick aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 4**
1) columns: dimension
2) rows: total tests completed (avg)
3) filter: dimension - exclude 0

3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 8**
1) columns: breed type, dog fixed
2) rows: total tests completed (avg)
3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 9** 
1) columns: breed type, dog fixed
2) rows: dna tested, total tests completed (avg)
3) 1: tested/fixed 0: not tested/not fixed
4) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 10** 
1) columns: country
2) rows: dog id (count distinct)
3) show me column: choose map

**Problem 11** 
1) columns: state
2) rows: user id (count distinct)
3) filter: country - US
4) order the columns from max to min
5) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 12** 

1) columns: state
2) rows: total tests completed (median)
3) filter: grouped dog id as shown in the clean data pattern, state: ME, NC, ND, SD, WY
4) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 13** 
please refer to the the reading material provided in week 2

**Problem 14** 
1) as above but set the filter: total tests completed < 19
2) as above (15)

**Problem 15**
1) to get the chart:
columns: total tests completed
rows: median ITI, mean ITI (all avg measures)
filter: total tests completed < 7
unclick aggregate measures in analysis
edit Axis: Fixed 0-10,000

2) key points in the linear function:
whether positive or negative: check the slope(the coefficient with median or mean ITI)
significant: p < 0.05 non-significant: p > 0.05
