## My hints for WEEK 2 Quiz
I have gotten stuck in week 2 for a couple of days and I have been so frustrated by almost all the problems in the quiz. I want to share my hints with you guys who have the same feeling.
Firstly, please clean the data according to the exercise, excluding dog ids with sign_in counts > 175.

**To clean the data**

1) unclick aggregate measures in analysis

2) rows: sign_in_count (sum)

3) drag dog ids into the marks card, detail

4) filter: sign_in_count < 175

5) select all the data, right click, then choose group

6) a new group (dog id group 1 here) has been created

7) put the new grouped dog id into filters from now on for the quiz

**Problem 1** 

1) rows: user id (count distinct)

2) filter: remove grouped dog id

3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 2**

1) columns: country, dimension, breed

2) rows: total tests completed (sum), weight

3) filter: state - 37

4) make sure to unclick aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 3** 

1) rows: sign in count(sum)

2) filter: remove the grouped dog id this time, sign in count > 175

3) view all data

4) make sure to unclick aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 4**

1) columns: dimension

2) rows: total tests completed (avg)

3) filter: dimension - exclude 0

4) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 5** 

1) columns: breed group

2) rows: total tests completed (both avg and median)

3) make sure to click aggregate measured in analysis

**Problem 6** 

1) columns: breed type

2) total tests completed (median)

3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 7** 

1) columns: breed type

2) total tests completed (median)

3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 8**

1) columns: breed type, dog fixed

2) rows: total tests completed (avg)

3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 9** 

1) columns: breed type, dog fixed

2) rows: dna tested, total tests completed (avg)

3) 1: tested/fixed 0: not tested/not fixed

4) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 10** 

1) columns: country

2) rows: dog id (count distinct)

3) show me column: choose map

**Problem 11** 

1) columns: state

2) rows: user id (count distinct)

3) filter: country - US

4) order the columns from max to min

5) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 12** 

1) columns: state

2) rows: total tests completed (median)

3) filter: grouped dog id as shown in the clean data pattern, state: ME, NC, ND, SD, WY

4) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 13** 

please refer to the the reading material provided in week 2

**Problem 14** 

1) as above but set the filter: total tests completed < 19

2) as above (15)

**Problem 15**

1) to get the chart:

columns: total tests completed

rows: median ITI, mean ITI (all avg measures)

filter: total tests completed < 7

unclick aggregate measures in analysis

edit Axis: Fixed 0-10,000

2) key points in the linear function:

whether positive or negative: check the slope(the coefficient with median or mean ITI)

significant: p < 0.05 non-significant: p > 0.05
