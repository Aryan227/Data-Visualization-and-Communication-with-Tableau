### Final Project

## Recommendation: Dognition Business Process Changes 
1) Implement Achievements such as badges to keep subcribers engaged
2) Send out targeted Reminders (to Users at Specific Tests Where engagement drops the most)
3) Use Social media as alternative to the free start promotion

Recommention: 
The Recommendations proposed are intended to reduce user drop off rates and increase completion rates. To get a better picture of 
this phemonema my data analysis will explore the following: demographics, user participation, drop off rates.

## Geographical Spread of the Customer
1# The US by far has the highest amount of Dognition customers in the world.
1# California is the state with the highest population of users. 

Comment: My strategy will Focus Marketing and Sales efforts in the following regions CA, NC, NY, TX, FL.

## Completion Rates: When Users are most Active

Graph 1: Time
At 7pm Dognition customers play the most amount of games

Graph 2: Day
On Sunday Customers play the most Dognition Games

Graph 3: Month
Month in the data set were the most tests completed: October 2014
Comment:
What Happened in Octoober 2014? Dognition was featured on "60 minutes" in Oct 2014. This reveals Publicity did work to increase user 
participation levels.

Strategy: Use targeted reminders

Comment:
In order to better target customers we need to look at when and where customers tend to play the games. Obviously from the charts, most users play the games during the 
beginning of a week and during the after-work period (05:00pm-20:00pm)

## Drop Off Rates: Insight to user behavior 

Graph 1: Free Start promotion was not successful
Dognition periodically tries offering a “Free Start” promotion to customers that gives the customers the first four tests for free. 
The hypothesis (or hope) would be that once potential customers get a chance to experience the product first-hand, they will be more
likely to buy a subscription. But from the below chart we can see that Free Start users dropped more after the fourth game than No 
Free Start users. So this promotion strategy is not effective as expected.

Conclusion:
“Free Start” promotion can be cancelled due to lack of effectiveness. 

Strategy:
Instead Post actively on Instagram, and Facebook from the Dognition team with intersting tips, facts, or some cute  pictures of dogs. 
Specially during the following days: Friday through Monday.

Graph 2: Percentage of completed Test: About 23% of their users complete 20 tests

Graph 3: Subcategoaries & Drop off rates: Eye Contact is the game where most dogs dropped off

Comment: There are five colors, meanings that there are five subcategories in the 20-question assessment.

## Conclusion: How to increase user participation levels and improve the user experience during tests

Recommendation: Recap
1) Implement Achievements 
*The idea here is to Create a badge system:To build a sense of accomplishment after completing a game. also encourages users to persist 
further to complete as many games as possible. Might even be a good a idea to hold tournments every once and awhile to bring users to 
compete for who has the most talented dog and who has the best personality relationship with his owner. 

2) Send out targeted Reminders 
*For reminders to be effected it's critical to send out during times where engagement drop the most 
(Eye Contact game which is the forth game). Also during times where users are most active such as after-work periods, and on Sundays
at 7pm.

3) Use Social media as alternative to the free start promotion.
*Free start was not effective I propose instead Instead Post actively on Instagram, and Facebook from the Dognition team with intersting
tips, facts, or some cute  pictures of dogs. Specially during the following days: Friday through Monday
