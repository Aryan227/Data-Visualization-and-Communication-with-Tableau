Comment:
Dognition may use reminder emails and online advertisement as alternative promotion strategies. In order to better target customers,
we need to look at when and where customers tend to play the games. Obviously from the charts, most users play the games during the 
beginning of a week and during the after-work period (05:00pm-20:00pm); Users are mainly located in United States and from California,
North Carolina and New York, Texas and Florida.

## Completion Rates: When Users are most Active

Month in the data set were the most tests completed: October 2014
Comment:
What Happened in Octoober 2014? Dognition was featured on "60 minutes" in Oct 2014. This reveals Publicity did work to increase user 
participation levels.

## Drop Off Rates: Insight to user behavior 

Graph 1: Free Start promotion was not successful
Dognition periodically tries offering a “Free Start” promotion to customers that gives the customers the first four tests for free. 
The hypothesis (or hope) would be that once potential customers get a chance to experience the product first-hand, they will be more
likely to buy a subscription. But from the below chart we can see that Free Start users dropped more after the fourth game than No 
Free Start users. So this promotion strategy is not effective as expected.

Conclusion:
“Free Start” promotion can be cancelled due to lack of effectiveness.
