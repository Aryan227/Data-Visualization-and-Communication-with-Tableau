Exercise  1.
#Data
Variables:

#Tableau
Columns: Test Name
Rows: CNT(Number of Records)
Filters: Test name

Commentary: observe the red arrows, at those points we see the highest number of test drops.

Exercise  2. 
Variables: 
Column: YEAR(Time Correction), QUARTER(Time Correction), MONTH(Time Correction), DAY(Time Correction), HOUR(Time Correction)
Rows: SUM(Number of Records)
Filters: WEEKDAY(Created at)

Formula: DATAADD('hour',[Diff from UTC], [Created at])

Exercise  3.
Question:  "Can you figure out how to set the advanced options so that the table calculation computes percentages separately 
for Free Start users vs non-Free Start users?"
-->click on the second CNTD(DogID), choose Edit Table Calculation... from the drop down list. When the dialog box pops up, 
choose Specific Dimension and Rank by DogID.

# Show % of total for Free Start Users and Not Free Start Users separately.
*Go to "Analysis" then choose "percentage of" and check "Table".
*Then If needed: Right-click on your variable and choose "compute using"

#Tableau
Columns: Free Start User (group), Rank by DogID
Rows: CNTD(Dog ID), CNTD(Dog ID)
Filters: Exclude Test Data
Color: Free Start User

#Conclusion:
So, only 5.72% of free-starters finished the 20-question Assessment, while 29.14% of non-free-starters finished the 20-question 
Assessment. The marketing strategy of giving the first four assessment tests for free did not seem to motivate people to finish more
tests with their dogs.

Exercise  4.
Questions: Can you make a similar calculation that ranks the tests completed by each user, mimicking the information provided in Rank
by UserID? Can you figure out how to include both ranks in the same table?

Steps:
1. Created calculated field
a. RANK(ATTR([Created at]),'asc')
2. Drag Rank from Measures to Marks Detail
3. Edit table calculation
a. Computing using: Specific Dimensions with Test name and Created at
4. Drag Rank to Row shelf

#Tableau
Columns:
Rows: Dog ID, Test name, DAteRank, Day(created)
Filters: Dog ID (group) Random
Details: DAteRank
