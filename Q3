## Mentor Hints for Week 3 Graded Quiz

# Introduction
For all questions, filter out the test accounts: the Shih Tzu that weigh more than 190 pounds. If you do not, the presence of these 
tests accounts will likely make your analysis inaccurate.
Right-click while in the Measure pane or go to Analysis. Choose Create Calculated Filed...

**You may use the following function.**
IF[Breed]="Shih Tzu"
AND[Weight]=190
THEN "Exclude"
ELSE "View"
END

--> Name the calculated field "Test Accounts" (or at least give it a descriptive name so that you know what the field is). For all 
questions, place this calculated field in the Filters card and select only View.

Question 1
Make sure you are using the appropriate variables to address this question.

#Tableau
Column: Rank by DogID
Rows: CNT(Number of records)
Filters: Test Accounts: View
Markdown: [Color: Subcategory Name]

# Analysis
--> The tallest four bars, in other words, highest record counts, are mostly orange, the color assigned by Tableau for the Empathy 
subcategory. There is still a little of orange in the 5th bar, but compared to the first 4 bars, it is marginal, indicating a large 
decrease in the Empathy subcategory in terms of counts of records. Indeed, if look at the big picture and examine each color from where 
it dominates the bars to where you have to look hard to see it (where a subcategory has a huge decrease in number of records) and 
compare the difference in Counts of Number of Records when you can easily see the color and when you have to look hard to find it, 
the difference in the orange color is the biggest, indicating that the largest drop-off occurs in the subcategory represented by the 
orange color. That's Empathy.

--> That graph shows that for those dogs that did not complete the 20 questions of the Assessment, most of them dropped off after they 
completed the Empathy subcategory. So, what do you think the answer to Q1 is? True or False. It should be easy to tell by now.

Question 2
It might help to color-code your graph for “Test Name.”
--> Each color now represents a test name. Using the same approach as in Q1 and each color from where it almost dominates the whole bar 
to where it is barely visible and compare the difference in Counts of Number of Records. You should find that the largest difference is
in the dark green color, the 4th bar that represents the Eye Contact game. Point your cursor to the 5th bar and carefully examine 
each color. There is no dark green at all.

Question 3
It might help to color-code your graph for “Test Name.”
--> Examine the graph for Q2. Point your cursor at the first bar and count the number of different colors in that bar. 
There are at least 4 different colors, meaning there are at least this many different sequences of tests were administered to 
the customers after the test accounts are taken out.



Question 4
Please check whether you are examining the correct variables or applying an inappropriate aggregation.


Question 5
Please see Lesson 5 Dashboards and Story Points to review how to use date fields in Tableau. 
Pay close attention to the consequences of treating dates as dimensions or measures.

--> Place Created At in Columns and Number of Records in Rows. As for the previous questions, place Test Account in Filters and select 
only View (please my explanation for Q1.)
--> Click on the Created At pill and choose Month (the second one that has the example "May 2015" next to it)

# Tableau
Column: Month(Correc...)
Rows: CNT(Number of Records)
Filters: Test Accounts View
--> Point your cursor to the highest point of the graph and you should see the month Q5 is asking for.

Question 6
Please see Practice Exercise 2 of this week to review how to use Tableau to answer this question.
Question 7
Check that you are using the correct aggregations, and try using the table calculation techniques described in 
Week 3’s Practice Exercise 3 to arrive at your answer.

calculation: RANK(([Created At]),'asc')

11. You are writing a calculation to rank each test a dog completed by its time stamp in the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set. 
You’ve configured your table calculation so that “Dog ID” and “Test Name” are in the Partitioning field 
and “Second Created” is in the Addressing field. The resulting rank will:

12.You are writing a calculation to include a column in a table that ranks each test a human user completed
by its time stamp in the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set. You put this column directly to the left of the column you made 
to rank each test a dog completed by its time stamp. The following field(s) will go in the 
Partitioning field in the calculation configuration page in your new calculation meant to rank each test a human user completed: 
(check all that apply)

For all questions, place this calculated field in the Filters card and select only View.

Q1: In the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, the greatest drop offs of test-takers occur after a subcategory of tests 
is completed rather than while the subcategories of tests are still in progress.

# Comments: 
The tallest four bars, in other words, highest record counts, are mostly orange, the color assigned by Tableau for the Empathy 
subcategory. There is still a little of orange in the 5th bar, but compared to the first 4 bars, it is marginal, indicating a 
large decrease in the Empathy subcategory in terms of counts of records. Indeed, if look at the big picture and examine 
each color from where it dominates the bars to where you have to look hard to see it (where a subcategory has a huge 
decrease in number of records) and compare the difference in Counts of Number of Records when you can easily see the color 
and when you have to look hard to find it, the difference in the orange color is the biggest, indicating that the 
largest drop-off occurs in the subcategory represented by the orange color. That's Empathy.

That graph shows that for those dogs that did not complete the 20 questions of the Assessment, most of them dropped off after 
they completed the Empathy subcategory. So, what do you think the answer to Q1 is? True or False. It should be easy to tell by now.

Q11: You are writing a calculation to rank each test a dog completed by its time stamp in the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set. 
You’ve configured your table calculation so that “Dog ID” and “Test Name” are in the Partitioning field and “Second Created” is
in the Addressing field. The resulting rank will:

#Comments:
The purpose of writing a calculation here is to, for each dog ID, rank the tests according to the order they were taken. 
For every dog ID, the first test taken would receive the rank 1, the second would receive the rank 2 and so on. 
The calculation should achieve the same purpose as the Ranked by Dog ID field.

Once you understand the purpose and function of the calculation, there is only "1" statement that stands out as the correct choice.
(I put 1 inside double quotations to emphasize it. Combined with the analysis above, do you get the hint?)

P.S. : You do not need to write the function, but if you like to explore like I do, you can write the function as follow:
Rank(ATTR([Created at]),"asc")
Make sure you specify "asc" for ascending. Otherwise, the default is descending and the last test a dog took would receive rank 1.
Name the calculation RANK (or any descriptive name that tells what it is).

Always keep the Test Account variable in the Filters card. You can ignore the Dog ID (group) variable shown here. 
It is a test variable I created to test the RANK function and contains only 5 randomly selected Dog ID's.

Place RANK in Detail. Right-click --> Edit Table Calculation ... If you have Tableau 2019.2 (the newest version when I downloaded it),
you would see the Table Calculation dialog box.

#Select the computing parameters as shown.
Change RANK to Discrete. The pill should be blue now.
Place Dog ID, Test Name and Rank in Rows in the following order.









Q10: If you were writing a calculation to rank each test a dog completed by its time stamp in the dognition_data_no_aggregation 
data set, what would be missing from the following version of your rank table calculation: RANK(([Created At]),'asc')

#Comments:
First of all, if you simply place the Created At variable inside the RANK function, 
Tableau will give you an error message at the bottom of the dialog box.

If you click on the triangle, you will see the details of the error message: 
"All fields must be aggregate or constants when using table calculation functions or fields from multiple data source".

After seeing the detail of this error message, you know immediately that the statement "there is nothing needed" should NOT be selected.
What about other statements?

Change RANK to Discrete. The pill should be blue now.
Place Dog ID, Test Name and Rank in Rows in the following order.

As I explained in Q10, the calculation using the RANK function ranks the tests a dog took in the order from the earliest to the last. 
For each dog, the first 1 receiving ranking 1.

Why don't you try it yourself?

By the way, when I wrote the calculation, I used the corrected hours. 
If you use the original Created At field, the hours you see on your table may be different, 
but they should not have any effect on the ranking.
